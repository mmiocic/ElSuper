# ElSuper
Repository for Waterpolo Stats App

Steps to setup project locally:


  1. Install Git
  
      --get latest version for your system
      
      --when the screen ask for specific Git settings, choose the one that says "with Linux commands" or something like that
      
      --after installation is done, make a directory and open a command line in that directory
      
      --now on the cmd line enter: git clone https://github.com/mmiocic/ElSuper.git
      
      --that directory that was created now has "ElSuper" and inside it is all the latest code
      
      --see .txt file for git commands that you should know for development, at least for this project
   
   
  2. Build Angular(frontend)
  
      --you need the AngularCLI but first you need to install node.js so google that and install the latest
      
      --now you should have the npm command available and you can check by doing "npm -v"
      
      --next, install a specific version of Angular so run the command "npm install -g @angular/cli@6.1.1"
      
      --check that it is properly install using "ng version" and you should see the CLI logo as well as 6.1.1 in there
      
      --finally go to the git directory, inside the angular project and run "ng serve -o" and you will see the project
      
      --{I will include the build step when it is ready}
  
  
  3. Startup Backend + Server
  
      --{TBD which language and framework to use so will update later}
