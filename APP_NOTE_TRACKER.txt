Water Polo Stat Tracker/ANALytics App 
	NOTES TRACKER
	
	

Important Items but not necessary ATM:
	-Name of the App
	-Color Scheme
	-Logo
	-Copyright/Liscensing?
	
	
Task Queue: (next things to add to app, preferably in this order)
	-Put page tabs for navigation and template of Team page, Analytics page and maybe one more
	-Add some Database structure (SQLite)
	-Put the other services
	-Implement methods to save data to DB from UI
	
	
Other Notes: (put any other ideas or whatever to consider)
	-I think a snapchat-like navigation is simple and could be more relavant since we dont have that many main pages
	-Within main pages, put some other navigation such as going to the stat tracker for games
	-Scoresheet page will include all the settings to put for each game
	-Scoresheet page will be default loaded and have like a news feeed of games to be loaded
	-Team editor self-explanitory: add,remove,edit players and teams that coaches have
	-ANALytics we need to decided on some data to be calculated once we are able to save data
	
	-Need to figure out a way to get the app to Tucker/Hunter without publishing to App Store so they can test it out and give comments
