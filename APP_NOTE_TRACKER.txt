Water Polo Stat Tracker/ANALytics App -->NOTES TRACKER

Backlog Items: (things to be decided but not crucial at the moment)
	-Name of the App
	-Color Scheme
	-Logo
	-Copyright/Liscensing?
	
	
Task Queue: (next things to add to app, preferably in this order)
	-Put template of Team page and analytics page...mainly to understand what are all the pages and navigation to the basic functions
	-Additionally to ^^ decide and implement Core navigation. (i am thinking something similar to snapchat where you select a tab from the bottom and takes you there)
	-Put the other services
	-Add some Database structure
	-Implement scoresheets to save data to DB
	
	
Other Notes: (put any other ideas or whatever to consider)
	-Like previously mentioned I think a snapchat-like navigation is simple and could be more relavant for this app since we dont have that many main functions (Scoresheet, Team editor, ANALytics)
	-Scoresheet page will include all the settings to put for each game
	-Scoresheet page will be default loaded and have like a news feeed of games to be loaded
	-Team editor self-explanitory: add,remove,edit players and teams that coaches have
	-ANALytics we need to decided on some data to be calculated once we are able to save data
